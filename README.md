# Project Proposal

### Project title

Clean Plates

### What and why?

Clean Plates aims to assist users with meal planning and preparation by providing personalized recipe suggestions based on ingredients they already have on hand. The app allows users to input their pantry and produce items and then generates recipe ideas that match their available ingredients. It also allows for customization based on dietary preferences, such as vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc. Additionally, Clean Plates provides a step-by-step cooking guide, complete with timers and visual aids, to help users follow the recipe. Users can also document their cooking experience and share it with friends and family. To keep users engaged, the app includes achievement badges that reward users for trying new recipes, cooking meals, and reaching milestones. The purpose of Clean Plates is to address several common challenges in meal planning and cooking. Many people struggle with deciding what to cook, especially when working with limited ingredients. This often leads to food waste, as people may not use what they already have. Clean Plates helps reduce food waste by ensuring that users can create meals based on the ingredients they already own. The app also promotes healthier eating by offering recipe suggestions tailored to specific dietary needs. By making cooking more accessible, enjoyable, and rewarding, Clean Plates fosters a healthier, more sustainable relationship with food.

### For whom?

The primary target audience for Clean Plates includes home cooks (both beginners and experienced) who are looking for an easy and interactive way to plan and prepare meals. It caters to individuals who want to eat healthier but struggle with meal planning, people who want to reduce food waste by using existing pantry items, and those following specific dietary preferences. The app also appeals to social users who enjoy documenting and sharing their cooking journey with friends and family. These users could range from busy individuals who need quick meal solutions to those looking for more immersive cooking experiences.

### How?

Clean Plates allows users to input the ingredients they have in their pantry or fridge by manually entering them or using a barcode scanning feature. Once the ingredients are entered, the app generates recipe suggestions that fit the userâ€™s available items and dietary preferences. Users can customize the app to suit their diet. After selecting a recipe, the app guides them through each cooking step, providing timers, visual cues, and detailed instructions. Users can document their cooking journey by taking photos, adding notes, and sharing their progress within the app or with friends. To encourage continued use, the app features a system of achievement badges that reward users for trying new recipes, cooking meals within specific dietary categories, and hitting milestones like cooking a certain number of meals.

### Scope

The core features (ingredient input, recipe generation, and guided cooking instructions) are manageable and can be implemented incrementally. The achievement badge system and social interaction provide an additional layer of engagement but can be integrated after the core features are functioning. Utilizing an API model for recipe data and external integrations could make it easier to achieve all goals. An API model would all access to a database of recipes, nutrition information, and dietary preferences.
